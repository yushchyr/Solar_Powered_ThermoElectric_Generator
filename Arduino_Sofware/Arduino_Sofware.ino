     * The Seebeck coefficient (also known as thermopower, thermoelectric power, and thermoelectric sensitivity) of a material 
     * is a measure of the magnitude of an induced thermoelectric voltage in response to a 
     * temperature difference across that material, as induced by the Seebeck effect. The SI unit of the Seebeck coefficient 
     * is volts per kelvin (V/K),although it is more often given in microvolts per kelvin (Î¼V/K).

  Equations:

  In general, the Seebeck effect is described locally by the 
  creation of an electromotive field.

   * If the system reaches a steady state, where J = 0,
